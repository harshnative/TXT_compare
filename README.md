working - 
1.  in the starting program will ask you for a number input - 

    enter 1 if you don't know the concept of directories - simple mode
    or 
    enter 2 if you know the directory destination of the files to be compared - adv mode
    
2.  now program will ask you for a number input 

    enter 0 if you want to compare the txt files without considering the letter casing in this case the 'a' and 'A' is considered same 
    or 
    enter 1 if you want to compare the txt files considering the letter casing in this case the 'a' and 'A' are considered different 
    
3.  now if you are in simple mode , two txt files will be created in the folder from         were you have runned the .exe program named as TXT1.txt and TXT2.txt
    
    now go ahead and copy and paste the txt material of the files to be compared in the TXT1.txt and TXT2.txt respectively 
    
    then press enter and skip step 4
    
4. now if you are in adv mode , you will be asked to mention the filename with its          directory path - see the below example
            
    If your XYZ.txt file is present at Destop in user named john then your path should be C:\Users\john\Desktop\XYZ.txt
    
    after succesfull reading of txt file 1 you will asked for txt file 2
    and the step will be repeated 
    
5. after that you will asked for a choice btw you want to compare whole file or not 
    - if you want to compare whole file then simply enter 0
    - if you want to compare to a to b then enter b first and enter a when asked
